This is a conversion page for the vet clinic VelciPet meant to allow users to make appointments. It asks for the user's name, pet's name, pet type, contact information, service requested, and preferred date. Once all the fields are properly filled out, the site takes the user to a thank you page. I was also supposed to create a landing site, however I fear that at my current skill level, I was unable to complete the site. However, this was a great learning experience and I had a lot of fun with it.
